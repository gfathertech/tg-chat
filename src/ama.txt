Samuel Babarere, Academic Director of the Student Consultative Forum (SCF) at Maduka University, is leading a transformative initiative to support ~100 late-resuming students and elevate Maduka to the forefront of tech-driven education. Samuel's vision includes:

Key Academic Initiatives

1. Teams-Based Lecture Recording System:

Using free Microsoft Teams, recorded lectures for 4 general studies courses and audio for pharmacy courses will be shared privately on YouTube and Telegram to support late-resuming students.



2. Coursework Enhancement Program:

Forming 15 study groups across 14 courses to create summaries, past questions, and provide peer support through Telegram.




These initiatives are designed to address challenges like no budget, limited Wi-Fi, and strict recording policies, while leveraging free tools like Teams, YouTube, and Telegram.

Tech Club and University Collaborations

Samuel is also establishing a Tech Club to develop coding skills and foster collaborations with top universities (UNILAG, LAUTECH, FUTA). The club will organize coding workshops, hackathons, and build a reputation for Maduka as a tech-savvy institution.

Timeline and Resources

Short-term (July–September 2025): Launch initiatives within two months, with no additional budget required.

Teamwork: 3 lecturers, 20 course reps, and 1 tech-savvy student leading the execution.


Benefits and Call to Action

Samuel’s initiatives will enhance student learning, improve exam success rates, and equip students with crucial tech skills, while positioning Maduka as a leader in both education and technology. He’s seeking support from the Vice-Chancellor to approve the recording plan and future budgets for data stipends and Demo Day.
